# MATLAB Audio Fingerprinting System
A Shazam-like audio recognition system implemented in MATLAB that creates acoustic fingerprints and matches audio samples against a database.

## Features
- Audio preprocessing (mono conversion, resampling, filtering)
- Spectrogram analysis with peak detection
- Hash-based fingerprint generation
- Database storage and querying
- Time-offset voting system for matching
- Confidence scoring for matches

## Requirements
- MATLAB R2018b or newer
- Signal Processing Toolbox
- Audio files in WAV format

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https:https://github.com/ameekbains/MATLAB-Audio-Fingerprinting-System
